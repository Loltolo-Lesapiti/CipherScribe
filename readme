# Ruby Exercises

This repository contains basic Ruby exercises offered by The Odin Project Ruby curriculum. It includes various programs and solutions to practice fundamental concepts of Ruby programming language.

## CipherScribe

CipherScribe contains a Ruby program for encoding and decoding messages using the Caesar cipher technique. This lightweight tool allows you to decrypt text with ease, providing a fun way to explore basic cryptography concepts.

### Usage

To use CipherScribe, simply run the program and follow the prompts to encode or decode your message. It's that easy!

### Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the `cipher_scribe.rb` file using Ruby.

## Substrings

Substrings is a Ruby program that counts the occurrences of words from a dictionary within a given input string. It's a helpful tool for analyzing text and identifying frequently used words.

### Usage

To use Substrings, call the `sub_string` function with the input text and dictionary as arguments.

```ruby
text = "Test string "
dict = ["est", "st"]
puts sub_string(text, dict)
# Output: {"est"=>1, "st"=>2}
