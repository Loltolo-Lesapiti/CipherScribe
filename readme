# Ruby Exercises

This repository contains basic Ruby exercises offered by The Odin Project Ruby curriculum. It includes various programs and solutions to practice fundamental concepts of Ruby programming language.

## CipherScribe

CipherScribe contains a Ruby program for encoding and decoding messages using the Caesar cipher technique. This lightweight tool allows you to decrypt text with ease, providing a fun way to explore basic cryptography concepts.

### Usage

To use CipherScribe, simply run the program and follow the prompts to encode or decode your message. It's that easy!

### Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the `cipher_scribe.rb` file using Ruby.

## Substrings

Substrings is a Ruby program that counts the occurrences of words from a dictionary within a given input string. It's a helpful tool for analyzing text and identifying frequently used words.

## Stockpicker

The Stock Picker is a simple Ruby program that helps users identify the best days to buy and sell stocks for maximum profit. This tool takes in an array of stock prices, where each element represents the price of a stock on a given day. It then analyzes these prices to determine the best days to buy and sell stocks to maximize profit.

### Usage

To use Substrings, call the `sub_string` function with the input text and dictionary as arguments.

```ruby
text = "Test string "
dict = ["est", "st"]
puts sub_string(text, dict)
# Output: {"est"=>1, "st"=>2}
